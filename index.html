                I'm a small town girl born in Northern California with big ambition and, as my father said, "... didn't know what couldn't be done." I learned that from him. I come from my father's lineage that fled Palatinate, Germany in 1729 and my mother's that came to America in 1897 from Troyes, France.

                My passion: EVERYTHING creative! I paint and draw, write poetry and screenplays, produce videos and live-recorded broadcasts, and host TV and radio shows, as well as, celebrity red-carpet events. I also study herbology, alchemy, quantum physics and the human brain. And, of course, I love coding.

                Some fun facts most people don't know: I bungee jumped off the Alderpoint Bridge in Northern California and from a crane at the Sturgis, South Dakota Harley Run. For years I created art, using French artist Yves Klein's "Living Brushes" technique (human paintbrushes), in front of a live audience.
